## üöÄ Features  
- **Time-Series Data Processing**: Prepares and scales historical stock price data for LSTM input.  
- **LSTM Model**: Built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict future stock prices.  
- **Visualization**: Graphs showing actual vs. predicted stock prices.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows tuning of hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, and window size.
